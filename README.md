# stabbo_kb
# lol this is old, messy code, need to do bunch of refactoring and add improvements soon 

is the codified version of one very famous disgruntled crustacean known for wielding a knife.

this arduino sketch 'stabs' at numerous windows keyboard shortcuts, that you define, to help identify any shortcuts for kiosk-mode
breakouts on windows systems.

Ideal for use with an arduino due and leonardo (due is the better bet though, easier, and more program memory).

Current form is just running through winkey + single letter combos, will add additional modifier keys soon.

# todo

clean up this code and add all the known win10/win7 shortcuts, and then add experimental features

  
# delays
Some systems aren't exactly the most responsive, so depending on the target, might need to increase delays in the function.

s/o to my dude
